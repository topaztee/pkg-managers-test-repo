* [#69](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-release/pull/69) Add Subversion support. Thanks [@timvlaer](https://github.com/timvlaer)!
* [#70](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-release/issues/70) Fixed failed attempt at detecting the need for cross building. Cross building needs to enabled by either setting `ReleaseKeys.crossBuild := true` or launch the release with `release cross`.
* [#78](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-release/pull/78) Use HEAD to determine current hash. Thanks [@larsrh](https://github.com/larsrh)!
